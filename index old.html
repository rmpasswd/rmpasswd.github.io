Hello,

<section id="intro">
<h2>My name is <span>Mahin Ahmad</span>. I am wannabe millionare with attachment issues.</h2>
I cant really pick one thing to focus one due to FOMO.

I want to learn Vue, then typescript then Deno,
Then python, golang, backend , AWS networking, support engineer architect, 
At the same time get into bug bounty and earn thousands of dollars.
Then learn management and and consulting.


Overall I'm an perfect storm of AHDH and a shitty mentor-less life, while also trying to being a lone-wolf.
